<h3>The man called otto</h3>
<p> message about the small wins of everyday people who operate as a functioning and harmonious community against the evils of faceless corporations. “A Man Called Otto” isn’t exactly as philosophical as “About Schmidt” or as socially conscious as “I, Daniel Blake,” two films that occasionally hit similar notes. But it’s nevertheless a wholesome crowd-pleaser for your next family gathering.</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>“I feel like I’m always searching for something, someone.” Haven’t we all felt that at some point in our lives? A sense of displacement from our daily lives, and a search for something that would anchor us to a more commonly perceived sense of normalcy? The Japanese phenomenon “Your Name” (it was the highest grossing film of last year in the country and the highest grossing anime film of all time worldwide, passing "Spirited Away") is about this highly relatable sense of looking for something, someone, someplace. And so much more. It’s a beautiful, captivating piece of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an emotional, powerful ending. And you won’t see a better-looking animated film all year.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>It's not a movie and yet it is included in the list because why not.........<br />
It doesn't rely on simplistic notions of good and evil. Instead, the show dives deep into the complexities of human nature and how our perspectives shape our actions. This is what sets Attack on Titan apart from other anime, and it's what keeps me coming back for more. It's not like most animes, about a hero against a villain, since the MC himself is not considered as a hero but a Anti-Hero.
But it's not just the philosophical depth that makes this show so compelling. The amount of realism in Attack on Titan is simply breathtaking. The show doesn't shy away from the cruel realities of human nature and the horrors of war. Instead, it confronts these topics head-on, forcing us to grapple with them in a way that few other shows do.
And then there's the amazing foreshadowing. Attack on Titan is a master class in how to plant seeds of plot and character development. Every episode is packed with hidden clues and subtle hints that leave me amazed
All in all, Attack on Titan is an unforgettable anime</p>
